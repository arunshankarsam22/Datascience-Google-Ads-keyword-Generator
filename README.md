# Datascience-Google-Ads-keyword-Generator


A simple python script that will help automate keyword building process for Google Ads, and Bing Ads. A list of frequenctly searched words for a partciular product is identified using Google Keyword Planner and Ubersuggest. Then those set of keywords are using to create a permutation of words, creating a possible ist of keywords that can be targeting in Google Ads and Bing Ads. I worked on a simple model as a prototype for a furniture store to help building keyword list and this script can be scaled even for the campaigns that has a higher keyword mix.
